# Maintenance Runbook

Primary runbook:
- `SYSTEM_CONTROL_CENTER/TRAINING_AND_MAINTENANCE.md`

This file exists as a stable entry point for operators.

## Quick Start
1. Read `SYSTEM_CONTROL_CENTER/README.md`.
2. Confirm current architecture in `SYSTEM_CONTROL_CENTER/ARCHITECTURE_CURRENT.mmd`.
3. Use `SYSTEM_CONTROL_CENTER/CHANGE_MAP.md` before editing behavior.
4. Keep governance docs and runtime changes synchronized in one change.
