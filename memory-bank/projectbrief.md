# Project Brief: Org Whiteboard

## Overview
An interactive organisational whiteboarding tool that enables users to visualise and navigate nested hierarchical structures within their organisation. The tool provides drill-down capabilities from organisation level down to automation level, with support for both agentic and linear workflow types.

## Core Requirements
1. **Nested Hierarchical Structures**: Organisation → Department → Team → Team Lead/Team Member → Sub Role → Tool → Workflow → Process → Agent → Automation
2. **Interactive Whiteboarding**: Click/drag pan, scroll/wheel zoom, double-click to drill down
3. **Workflow Types**: Support for both agentic (AI-driven) and linear (sequential) workflows
4. **Tool Integration**: Ability to add tools (ClickUp, Gmail, etc.) at team/role levels
5. **AI-Powered Generation**: Generate organisational structures from text prompts using Gemini AI
6. **Conversational Updates**: Chat widget for real-time modifications

## Goals
- Replace ClickUp whiteboarding with a better alternative
- Enable visual workflow mapping and process mapping
- Support deep navigation into organisational structures
- Provide AI-assisted organisation design

## Target Users
- Teams needing to visualise organisational structures
- Operations teams doing workflow mapping
- Anyone needing to understand complex organisational hierarchies

## Success Metrics
- Ability to navigate 10+ levels of hierarchy
- Smooth pan/zoom interactions
- AI-generated structures that match user intent
