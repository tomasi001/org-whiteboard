# Project Brief

## Project Name
Org Whiteboard

## Core Objective
Build an interactive organisational whiteboarding tool for workflow mapping and process mapping, enabling users to create nested hierarchical structures with drill-down capabilities for departments, roles, and workflows.

## Key Features
1. **Nested Structure Visualisation**: Click into departments, teams, and roles to gain deeper insight
2. **Interactive Whiteboarding**: Rich interactive canvas for visualising organisational structures
3. **Workflow Mapping**: Map both agentically orchestrated and linearly automated processes
4. **Documentation Previews**: View documentation directly within the whiteboard
5. **Deep Drill-down**: Navigate through nested hierarchies with ease

## Target Users
- Teams needing workflow mapping
- Organisations doing process mapping
- Anyone needing to visualise nested organisational structures

## Success Criteria
- Users can create whiteboards with nested hierarchies
- Users can drill down into departments/teams/roles
- Users can add agentic or linear workflow types
- Users can link documentation to nodes
- Build passes without errors
