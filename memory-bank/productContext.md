# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The user wanted a better organisational whiteboarding tool than ClickUp's offering. The goal is to create a tool specifically designed for workflow mapping and process mapping with nested hierarchical structures.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Poor existing tools**: ClickUp whiteboarding is not great for nested organisational structures
2. **Lack of drill-down**: Existing tools don't allow easy navigation into departments/teams/roles
3. **No workflow type distinction**: Need to visualise both agentic (AI-driven) and linear (automated) processes

## How It Should Work
- Users create a whiteboard starting with an organisation
- They can add departments, teams, roles as children
- Each level can be drilled into by clicking
- Workflows and processes can be marked as agentic or linear
- Documentation links can be attached to any node
- Breadcrumb navigation allows easy backtracking

## User Experience Goals
- Clean, simple interface
- Intuitive drill-down navigation
- Clear visual distinction between node types
- Easy workflow type identification
- Smooth zoom and pan controls
